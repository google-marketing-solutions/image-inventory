        "#  Push Products to Image Inventory for Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "## Description\n",
        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook provides an alternative way to selectively classify products\n",
        "using Image Inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of having the solution \"always-on\" (meaning that the entire feed is classified and new products are classified as they are being added), this solution allows you manually select a subset of products to run through the classification pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "## References\n",
        "\n",
        "For more info, please check out the repository on [Github (google-marketing-solutions/image-inventory)](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/image-inventory)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## How it works\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook utilizes the same codebase as the \"always-on\" deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "+ In the \"always-on\" deployment - push_products_lib is called by a Cloud Run Function\n",
        "\n",
        "+ In this colab notebook - you are manually calling the methods in push_products_lib.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start and connect to a runtime (in the top right corner)\n",
        "2. Execute each code block (in sequence) by pressing the play icon next to each block.\n",
        "\n",
        "+ **Authenticate user** - sets up authentication for Google services\n",
        "+ **Install repo & dependencies** - clones repo from Github & uses pip to install required modules\n",
        "   + Note: this step may require you to restart the runtime.\n",
        "+ **Fill out form fields** - sets required configuration values\n",
        "   + Note: if your Image Inventory deployment uses default values for the [optional config parameters](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/image-inventory?tab=readme-ov-file#4-provide-values-for-variables), then you only need to fill out ```project_id```\n",
        "   + Be sure to rerun this code block after changing any values.\n",
        "+ **Define product filters** - choose one or more values that will be used to filter products in the feed\n",
        "   + For product type, the filter uses a \"starts with\" comparison, so when you provide a product type like \"Electronics,\" it will identify and include any product types that begin with \"Electronics,\" such as \"Electronics > TVs\" or \"Electronics > Audio.\n",
        "+ **Pull set of products** - this stages the set of products from BigQuery for classification, the product data is shown in a table for validation purposes.\n",
        "   + If ```exclude_previously_clasified_products``` is enabled, then the solution will only pull in product image links that have not been run through Image Inventory before\n",
        "   + When ```exclude_previously_clasified_products``` is disabled and if multiple products in the pull have the same link, those links will be processed multiple times.\n",
        "+ **Push set of products for analysis** - this is the step where products are pushed to Image Inventory for analysis.\n",
        "+ **Get generated classifications** - after Image Inventory has finished classifying the submitted products, this block queries the ```get_product_image_classifications``` BigQuery view to get the classifications by product."
